# breeding-rhythms
Interactive project that uses a genetic algorithm to generate new rhythms based on user feedback

You can listen to and look at rhythms and like or dislike them. The new “generations” of rhythms generated are based on the rhythms you like.

Submit your favourite rhythms and check out the API for all or a selection of submitted rhythms.
